# Unity NavMesh & Raycasting System

A learning-focused Unity prototype created to understand
NavMesh navigation, AI movement, and raycasting-based combat.

This project focuses on system-level implementation rather
than visual polish.


## System Overview
- VIP character navigates a city using NavMesh
- Randomized path selection between multiple waypoints
- Random monster spawning
- Mouse-based raycasting shooting system
- Health system for VIP
- Damage when monsters approach VIP

## AI & Navigation
- NavMeshAgent-based movement
- Random destination selection
- Path recalculation using NavMesh

## Combat System
- Mouse click raycasting
- Monster elimination on hit
- Health reduction when monsters are nearby

## Tools & Concepts Used
- Unity NavMesh
- Raycasting
- AI pathfinding
- Health & damage systems
- C#

## Note
This project is a functional prototype created to understand
NavMesh and Raycasting concepts. Visuals and audio are not
final and were not the primary focus.
